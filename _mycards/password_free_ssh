 Instructions to configure a password-free SSH
 =============================================
* In the local (client) computer:
ssh-keygen -t rsa

* Copy the generated ~/.ssh/id_rsa or ~/.ssh/id_dsa to the remote (server) computer.

* In the remote (server) computer:
cat id_rsa.pub >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys

* If you use a different file name (instead of id_rsa), add the following to the file named    ~/.ssh/config (create if it does not exist):
Host hostname.com
     IdentityFile /home/username/.ssh/filename
(where filename is the desired private key name, and hostname.com is the desired host.)
